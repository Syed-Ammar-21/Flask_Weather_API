# 🌍 Flask Weather API

This project is a **Flask-based Weather API** that fetches real-time weather data using the **OpenWeather API**. Firstly read the Questions zip file to understand below  mentioned tasks.

It includes:

- **Task 1**: Basic Flask API with weather data  
- **Task 2**: Error handling for invalid city names  
- **Task 3**: Fetching weather for multiple cities  
- **Task 4**: Deployment using Ngrok
- **Question 1 client/server**: A server fetches real-time weather data (temperature, humidity, pressure) from a third-party API and evaluates crop health based on predefined optimal conditions,whereas client sends requests to the server with a city and crop type to receive the health status of the crop in that city.
- **Agriculture**: This task involves designing and implementing a Flask-based RESTful API to help farmers manage their agricultural needs efficiently. The API will provide multiple services, including crop advisory, bank loan approval, seed and fertilizer procurement, and transport logistics.
- Both **Question 1 client/server** and **Agriculture** are in zip files. Separate zip files for code and output screenshots with a detailed word document explaining things and flowchart.
